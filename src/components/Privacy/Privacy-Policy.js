                Welcome to Myspacemaxcen. This application has been developed by Max as a part of my professional portfolio to showcase my technical skills in web and app development. Please note the following key points regarding the use of this application:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>**Purpose:** Myspacemaxcen is solely a demonstration project. It is designed to exhibit my abilities in integrating and implementing various functionalities, including Google and GitHub login authentication, within a web application. This app is not intended for commercial use or for general public usage.
                </li>
                <li>**Data Collection and Usage:** This application requires user login and thus collects data necessary for authentication and user identification. After logging in, to manage your account, click on the user icon located in the top right corner. This will reveal a dropdown menu with several options. Select 'Account' to navigate to your account page. At the bottom of this page, you will find the 'Delete Account' button, which allows you to permanently delete your account and all data associated with it.
                </li>
                <li>**No Third-Party Sharing:** No data is shared with third parties, as the application does not collect personal data beyond what is necessary for demonstration purposes. This includes adherence to strict privacy standards and ensuring the confidentiality of any demonstration data used within the app.
                </li>
                <li>**Contact Information:** For any inquiries or questions regarding this privacy policy or the application, please contact me at max@maxcen.dev.This privacy policy may be updated or changed as required, with the latest version always available on this page.
